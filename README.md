# Graph Vizualizer
![alt text](https://github.com/AlimByWater/AlimByWater.github.io/blob/master/media/presentation.gif.gif)

It's a simple graph vizualizer.

You can set it with adjency matrix.
By settings your graph might be with [more than one edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph) per pair of vertecies, with loops and only **undirected**.

Also you can switch to [complement graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph).
This simply means that all connections on your initial graph will be inverted.\

alt = "Complement graph" width="50%" height = "50%">

This works on Vis.js Network library and jQuery.\
Perhaps later I will change all comments to English.
